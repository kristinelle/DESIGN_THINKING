# Design Thinking Activity
This report explores how design thinking addresses Chapter 5 (Database and Data Analytics) problems.

## Reflection

**What I learned throughout this activity**

Engaging in design thinking has taught me the importance of user-centric problem-solving. Through phases like empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing, I realized the significance of empathy and collaborative brainstorming. The creation and testing of the eduTrack prototype underscored the need for continuous refinement and a more robust feedback loop.

**Improvements**

While effective, the design thinking process can benefit from a more enhanced feedback loop during the prototype and testing phases. Additionally, it emphasized the importance of adaptability and interdisciplinary collaboration in problem-solving.

**My conclusion**

In conclusion, this experience not only provided a problem-solving framework but also instilled a mindset that values empathy, collaboration, and adaptability when tackling complex challenges.
